# Bio

I am a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at [Google Research India](https://research.google/locations/india/), working in the [AI for Social Good lab](https://blog.google/technology/ai/30-new-ai-for-social-good-projects/) mentored by [Prof. Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe). My work focuses on developing robust bandit algorithms for efficiently delivering health awareness information in underserved communities in India.

I'm interested in reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems with applications in robotics, public health and environmental conservation. I want to develop agents that learn behaviours which are transferable to real-world domains, are scalable through communication and are understandable and acceptable by humans.

Previously, I was a Data Scientist at United Health Group where I worked on modelling healthcare risks for millions of beneficiaries.
My CV is available <a href="https://vermashresth.github.io/img/Shresth_CV_Research_Clean%20(4).pdf" target="_blank">here</a>

I graduated from [Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management Gwalior](iiitm.ac.in) in 2020. I have also actively contributed to Open Source Scientific Computing Community with feature additions and patches in projects such as OpenCV, AstroPy, SciPy, Shogun ML Toolkit, Chainer and TensorForce. 

On the side, I maintain [Jupyer Probe](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-probe/), a library to monitor, manage, declare and analyse notebook resource usage on jupyter environments.
I am also an avid bird watcher and photographer and post pictures from my adventures on [Instagram](instagram.com/hisblahness).
