# Bio

I am a Masters of Science student in Machine Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) where I am learning about how to conduct specialized ML theoretical and applied research through coursework in Advanced Machine Learning, Intermediate Statistics and Deep Reinforcement Learning and Control. Previously, I was a pre doctoral researcher at Google DeepMind, previously [Google Research India](https://research.google/locations/india/), working in the [MASSI lab](https://blog.google/technology/ai/30-new-ai-for-social-good-projects/) mentored by [Prof. Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe). My work focused on developing robust bandit algorithms for efficiently delivering health awareness information in underserved communities in India. My Resume is available <a href="/img/Arshika_Lalan_Resume_Final.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

Even before, I was a Research Assistant at the [Kreiman Lab](https://klab.tch.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University where I worked on adopting continual learning algorithms for continuous domain adaptations.

My research interest lies in leveraging reinforcement learning and lifelong learning to develop embodied AI agents capable of sensing and interacting with a dynamic environment, driving towards more robust and adaptive AI systems. I am also interested in applying my current coursework to build and refine theoretical approaches to these challenges.

I graduated from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) in 2022. At BITS, I was mentored by [Prof. Snehanshu Saha](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/snehanshu-saha/) and [Dr. Basabdatta Sen Bhattacharya](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/basabdatta-bhattacharya/). I also have a deep appreciation for teaching , and I have experience as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in three courses: Object-Oriented Programming, Database Systems, and Econometric Methods. In my free time, I served as a volunteer instructor in Mathematics and English for women and children hailing from the underprivileged families that contributed to the campus's operations. I enjoy writing as a medium of creative expression and you can find some of my works [here](https://bethenovelpoet.wordpress.com/), [here](https://store.pothi.com/book/arshika-lalan-dear-diary/) and [here](https://medium.com/@arshika77).
